# Defuse-the-Bomb-Game
Make a game that lets you "defuse" a bomb like on TV.

Will include:
1. Countdown timer!
2. 3 or more wires that can be "cut"(unplugged). Cutting the correct wire will result in clock stopping, and something lighting up to        indicate that the bomb has been defused. The other 2 wires will result in the bomb "detonating" by a sound and light indication.
   The "safe wire" will be set at random on each instance of the game.
3. A cool enclosure.
